# davidcel.is

This is the code for my personal website and blog, which you can visit at [davidcel.is](https://davidcel.is/)! It's a Ruby on Rails application that's still under active development.

Right now, you can read a short bio of me, peruse some articles and notes I've already written, and even subscribe to RSS Feeds of my articles, notes, or all of my posts combined. Soon, I hope to add full support for writing those short-form notes and an authenticated posting interface for myself so I can just pull out my phone, type up my short thoughts, and hit "Send", just like I would have on Twitter (RIP).

The design is a modified version of [Tailwind's Transmit UI template](https://tailwindui.com/templates/transmit), but the code was written by me, and it was largely written for me. There's a lot of hard-coded personal text, and there's currently no theming to make it easy to customize its appearance. You're free to use this code to develop your own website, but you'll want to do proper personalization to make it yours!
