                If you know me, you know I love food. If you don‚Äôt know me, well, now you know at
                least one thing about me! I‚Äôve lived in Portland since 2011, so I‚Äôve amassed a
                decent list of favorite places to eat and drink. Portland‚Äôs a small city, but it
                punches way above its weight when it comes to the food scene. I love it when people
                visit and get to experience that for themselves, so I‚Äôve put together a list of
                some of my favorite places to eat and drink around the city. I also keep a longer
                list of recommendations on Apple Maps and try to keep it up to date with new places
                I‚Äôve tried and enjoyed; if you‚Äôre planning a longer trip, you should

                <a href="https://maps.apple.com/?auid=3574528002939766542" target="_blank">Coava</a> is my current
                favorite roaster in Portland. Their flagship location in the Central Eastside is open, airy, and
                industrial, if that‚Äôs your kind of thing. They‚Äôre fairly no-nonsense: they have consistently good
                blends and single origins, and the coffee is always great whether you're getting an espresso,
                pour-over, or milky drinks.

                <a href="https://maps.apple.com/?auid=13533799804601000861" target="_blank">Roseline</a> is another
                excellent roaster in Portland, and their flagship NE Davis location is brand new and beautiful! They
                crank out delicious espresso, but they also frequently have interesting and delicious seasonal
                drinks if you like to branch out from the usual.

                <a href="https://maps.apple.com/?auid=11141747485174786297" target="_blank">Proud Mary</a> is where
                I send my fellow coffee nerds, the sickos who need the very best, regardless of the price. They‚Äôre a
                Melbourne import and they pretty much always have rare and interesting coffees. They pull fantastic
                espresso, but I think pour-over is where they shine, especially with the rare stuff.

                bialys. They‚Äôre similar to bagels (though not boiled), with a depression in the middle instead of
                a hole. Bialy Bird makes theirs fresh daily, with seasonal fillings and schmears that change almost
                every week. Try a small variety (the okonomiyaki bialy is standout and always available) or get an
                incredible breakfast sandwiches made with any of their bialys!

                <a href="" target="_blank">Starter Bread</a> is a sourdough-focused bakery that makes some of the

                I wouldn‚Äôt bother with their coffee, though; grab something to go and head a few blocks south to
                <a href="https://maps.apple.com/?auid=13159147533936391813" target="_blank">Courier</a> for your

                is near and dear to my heart. And my body (they‚Äôre my neighborhood coffee shop). They use Proud Mary
                beans to make good coffee, and they make great pastries in-house with a wide selection as well as a
                small breakfast/lunch menu. The star of the show here, though, is the cinnamon roll. Pray that you
                luck out and pop in when they‚Äôre pulling a batch fresh from the oven.

                Olli is my favorite. The toppings are fresh and interesting with 2-3 seasonal pizzas on the menu,
                but the always-available Pomodoro might just be my favorite pizza <em>ever</em>. Do yourself a
                favor and add stracciatella.

                seasonal fish from Japan. You‚Äôll need a reservation, but they do have a smaller 5-seat counter for
                walk-ins (and a la carte ordering) if you didn‚Äôt plan ahead. The best part? You won‚Äôt pay nearly

                casual locations in Japan, the Portland location is an upscale izakaya with a full menu of
                small plates, skewers, sushi, and ramen (of course). Go with some friends (and me?), share a
                bunch of food, and finish off with a bowl of the yuzu shio (or yuzu ratan if you‚Äôre feeling spicy).

                Get some chicken and jojos. Get them loaded. Get a fried chicken sandwich or a smashburger.
                Get dessert! Vegetarian or vegan? No problem, they have vegetarian/vegan options for pretty
                much everything on the menu, with fried tofu, beyond meat, and vegan cheeses. They‚Äôre also
                known for being completely unhinged on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jojo.pdx" target="_blank">social media</a>.

                if you're indecisive like me, let them choose what to bring you. Show up between 5-6pm for

                amazing food a la carte, but I recommend going hungry and doing the rijsttafel. They‚Äôll fill

                <a href="https://maps.apple.com/?auid=4998596448420477506" target="_blank">Dame</a> is a great
                place to sip on some natural wine (and, if you‚Äôre hungry, eat a great dinner). They also have
                a small bottle shop if you want to take some wine home with you.

                In a city that‚Äôs full of breweries, <a href="https://maps.apple.com/?auid=23089384799060284" target="_blank">Breakside</a>
                has been a favorite of mine for years. They have a new location in Slabtown with more taps, but
                their original location on Dekum is still a regular spot for me since it‚Äôs three blocks from my
                home. They‚Äôve unfortunately made some bad changes to their food program recently, but it‚Äôs still
                a great place to drink some local beer.

                fantastic Portland patisserie, and I especially love their sweet pastries and macarons. They
                often put out fun specials on the weekends, but they do tend to form lines and sell out.

                is one of those Portland institutions that‚Äôs still worth going to after all these years. Get a
