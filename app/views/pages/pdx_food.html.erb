                If you know me, you know I love food. If you don‚Äôt know me, well, now you know at
                least one thing about me! I‚Äôve lived in Portland since 2011, so I‚Äôve amassed a
                decent list of favorite places to eat and drink. Portland‚Äôs a small city, but it
                punches way above its weight when it comes to the food scene. I love it when people
                visit and get to experience that for themselves, so I‚Äôve put together a list of
                some of my favorite places to eat and drink around the city. I also keep a longer
                list of recommendations on Apple Maps and try to keep it up to date with new places
                I‚Äôve tried and enjoyed; if you‚Äôre planning a longer trip, you should

                new favorite of mine. They do great small-batch light roasts that result in deliciously bright,
                fruit-forward espresso drinks. I‚Äôve only been a few times so far, but the cappuccinos and
                cortados have been some of the best I‚Äôve ever had, with the espresso managing to shine through
                the milk in a way that many other places can‚Äôt seem to manage.

                consistently two of my favorite roasters in Portland, and both have multiple locations around
                Portland. Coava‚Äôs flagship location is a bright, airy, and industrial space in the Central Eastside
                and Roseline‚Äôs flagship location on NE Davis St. is brand new and beautiful. Coava is great for
                no-nonsense espresso drinks and pour-overs; Roseline is good for this too, but they also always
                have fun and interesting seasonal drinks on the menu.

                espresso, but I think pour-over is where they shine, especially with the rare stuff.

                bialys. They‚Äôre similar to bagels (though not boiled), with a depression in the middle instead of
                a hole. Bialy Bird makes theirs fresh daily, with seasonal fillings and schmears that change almost
                every week. Try a small variety (the okonomiyaki bialy is standout and always available) or get an
                incredible breakfast sandwiches made with any of their bialys!

                beans to make good coffee, and they make great pastries in-house with a wide selection as well as a
                small breakfast/lunch menu. The star of the show here, though, is the cinnamon roll. Pray that you
                luck out and pop in when they‚Äôre pulling a batch fresh from the oven.

                win a lot of awards, and it‚Äôs definitely worth visiting (early, to avoid waiting for hours), but Cafe
                Olli is my favorite. The toppings are fresh and interesting with 2-3 seasonal pizzas on the menu,
                but the always-available Pomodoro might just be my favorite pizza <em>ever</em>. Do yourself a
                favor and add stracciatella.

                with seasonal fish from Japan. You‚Äôll need a reservation, but they do have a smaller 5-seat counter
                for walk-ins (and a la carte ordering) if you didn‚Äôt plan ahead. The best part? You won‚Äôt pay nearly
                as much as you would for a similar experience in NY or SF.

                casual locations in Japan, the Portland location is an upscale izakaya with a full menu of
                small plates, skewers, sushi, and ramen (of course). Go with some friends (and me?), share a

                specialty is Hat Yai fried chicken, malayu curry, and buttery roti. The chicken is amazing, but
                whatever you do, don‚Äôt skip the curry or roti!

                Get some chicken and jojos. Get them loaded. Get a fried chicken sandwich or a smashburger.
                Get dessert! Vegetarian or vegan? No problem, they have vegetarian/vegan options for pretty
                much everything on the menu, with fried tofu, beyond meat, and vegan cheeses. They‚Äôre also
                known for being completely unhinged on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jojo.pdx" target="_blank">social media</a>.

                if you're indecisive like me, let them choose what to bring you. Show up between 5-6pm for
                their oyster happy hour and sip on something from their great wine list!

                Indonesian-focused restaurant that I love taking friends to when they visit. You can order some
                amazing food a la carte, but I recommend going hungry and doing the rijsttafel. They‚Äôll fill
                your table with lots and lots of small plates and you can try most of the menu!

                <a href="https://maps.apple.com/?auid=18333499069996454726" target="_blank">Expatriate</a> makes
                killer cocktails in a space that just oozes ambiance. The menu is small, and each drink has a
                surprising number of ingredients that belies the balance of the final product. I love getting
                the ‚Äúdiplomatic pouch‚Äù and letting the bartender craft something unique while I munch on their
                onion and butter sandwich (trust me) or shrimp toast.

                <a href="https://maps.apple.com/?auid=13533948818568126511" target="_blank">Scotch Lodge</a> is
                probably the best place in Portland to drink whisk(e)y if you aren‚Äôt already a member of the
                <a href="https://maps.apple.com/?auid=289993969095376392" target="_blank">Multnomah Whiskey Library</a>.
                They boast a large selection of bottles, a great cocktail menu, and some of the most beautifully
                plated food you‚Äôll find in a bar.

                <a href="https://maps.apple.com/?auid=1007769458497924235" target="_blank">Tulip Shop Tavern</a> is
                deceptive. I wouldn‚Äôt call it a dive, but it‚Äôs an unpretentious bar with some punk/grunge vibes
                that still manages to make some very well crafted cocktails while the kitchen churns out classic
                (but incredibly well executed) bar food. Their burger is one of the best in the whole city.

                <a href="https://maps.apple.com/?auid=4998596448420477506" target="_blank">Dame</a> is a great
                place to sip on some natural wine (and, if you‚Äôre hungry, eat a great dinner). They also have
                a small bottle shop if you want to take some wine home with you.

                In a city that‚Äôs full of breweries, <a href="https://maps.apple.com/?auid=23089384799060284" target="_blank">Breakside</a>
                has been a favorite of mine for years. They have a new location in Slabtown with more taps, but
                their original location on Dekum is still a regular spot for me since it‚Äôs three blocks from my
                home. They‚Äôve unfortunately made some bad changes to their food program recently, but it‚Äôs still
                a great place to drink some local beer.

                fantastic Portland patisserie, and I especially love their sweet pastries and macarons. They
                often put out fun specials on the weekends, but they do tend to form lines and sell out.

                <a href="https://maps.apple.com/?auid=4407415904335867605" target="_blank">Pronto Gelato</a> is a
                relative newcomer, offering up classic Gelato flavors like pistachio and stracciatella with some
                seasonal flavors and sorbettos. You can also get an affogato with espresso from

                is one of those Portland institutions that‚Äôs still worth visiting after all these years. Get a
