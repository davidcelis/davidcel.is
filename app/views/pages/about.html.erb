            Hey there, I’m David! I’m a staff software engineer at
            <a href="https://firehydrant.com" class="link-primary" target="_blank">FireHydrant</a>
            (where I write APIs 🧑‍💻) out in Portland, Ore. (where I drink IPAs 🍻). I’ve been in the
            tech industry for over a decade and have worked for a number of top-tier companies such
            as <a href="https://stripe.com/" class="link-primary" target="_blank">Stripe</a>,
            <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/" class="link-primary" target="_blank">HashiCorp</a>,

            Despite (or perhaps because of) my time in tech, I rarely write about it and try to spend my
            free time on  nearly anything else. I have a few core interests that help keep me relaxed and
            fulfilled, but I try to keep the list small because I’m the kind of person who gets overwhelmed
            when they try to do too many things at once.

            🍱 I’m really into food! I love to cook and explore the food scene in Portland. I’ve also recently
            been trying to get more into food photography, so expect to see plenty of food pics in my posts 📸
          </p>

          <p>
            ☕️ I’m also a big coffee nerd. I’ve been brewing espresso at home since getting a hand-me-down
            starter machine while I was still in school. These days, I get to brew on my dream machine: a
            custom La Marzocco GS/3! Along with food photography, you should expect to see plenty of pics/vids
            of me brewing espresso 😅

            🎹 I like to play piano for myself to relax at home, but I used to be in bands before the pandemic.
            If you’re at all curious, I’ve been on a
            <a href="https://ezrabell.bandcamp.com/album/dont-all-look-up-at-once" class="link-primary" target="_blank">couple</a>
            <a href="https://thejackalopesaints.bandcamp.com/album/ivory-crown" class="link-primary" target="_blank">albums</a>
            playing 🎺 trumpet and 🎹 keys!

            🐕 I have a little Dachshund/Mini-Pinscher named Susan Bones and I take her on long walks. She is
            very neurotic and I love her.
