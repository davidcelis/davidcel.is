                Hey there, I’m David! I’m a principal software engineer at
                <a href="https://firehydrant.com" target="_blank">FireHydrant</a> (where I write APIs 🧑‍💻) out in
                Portland, Ore. (where I drink IPAs 🍻). I’ve been in the tech industry for over a decade and have
                worked for a number of top-tier companies such as
                <a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank">Stripe</a>,
                <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/" target="_blank">HashiCorp</a>,
                <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>,
                <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank">DigitalOcean</a>, and
                <a href="https://newrelic.com" target="_blank">New Relic</a>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Despite (or perhaps because of) my time in tech, I rarely write about it and try to spend my
                free time on  nearly anything else. I have a few core interests that help keep me relaxed and
                fulfilled, but I try to keep the list small because I’m the kind of person who gets overwhelmed
                when they try to do too many things at once.
              </p>

                🍱 I’m really into food! I love to cook and explore the food scene in Portland. I’ve also recently
                been trying to get more into food photography, so expect to see plenty of food pics in my posts 📸
                Visiting Portland and want some recommendations? Check out my page all about
                <%= link_to "PDX Food", pdx_food_path %>!
              </p>

                ☕️ I’m also a big coffee nerd. I’ve been brewing espresso at home since getting a hand-me-down
                starter machine while I was still in school. These days, I get to brew on my dream machine: a
                custom La Marzocco GS/3! Along with food photography, you should expect to see plenty of pics/vids
                of me brewing espresso 😅

                🎹 I like to play piano for myself to relax at home, but I used to be in bands before the pandemic.
                If you’re at all curious, I’ve been on a
                <a href="https://ezrabell.bandcamp.com/album/dont-all-look-up-at-once" target="_blank">couple</a>
                <a href="https://thejackalopesaints.bandcamp.com/album/ivory-crown" target="_blank">albums</a>
                playing 🎺 trumpet and 🎹 keys!

                🐕 I have a little Dachshund/Mini-Pinscher named Susan Bones and I take her on long walks. She is
                very neurotic and I love her.

              All of the comments, likes, and reposts on this site are powered by
              <a href="https://indieweb.org/Webmention" target="_blank">Webmentions</a>! Most of them automatically
              come from responses to my posts on Mastodon, Bluesky, and other social networks via
              <a href="https://brid.gy/" target="_blank">brid.gy</a>; if you interact with one of my posts on
              those networks, it shows up here too! But the beauty of Webmentions is that you can also respond to my
              posts on your own website; as long as you send a Webmention, and your site is properly marked up using
              <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2" target="_blank">microformats</a>, it’ll show up
              here as if you’d responded on a social network. If you’re interested in learning more about Webmentions,
              or if you sent me a webmention that isn’t showing up on my site, feel free to email me!
