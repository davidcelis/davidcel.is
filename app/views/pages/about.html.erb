                Hey there, I’m David! I’m a principal software engineer at
                <a href="https://firehydrant.com" target="_blank">FireHydrant</a> (where I write APIs 🧑‍💻) out in
                Portland, OR (where I drink IPAs 🍻). I’ve worked in the tech industry for about fifteen years and
                have been at a number of top-tier companies like
                <a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank">Stripe</a>,
                <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/" target="_blank">HashiCorp</a>,
                <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>,
                <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank">DigitalOcean</a>, and
                <a href="https://newrelic.com" target="_blank">New Relic</a>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Despite (or because of) my time in tech, I don’t write about it often and try to spend my
                free time on  nearly anything else. I have a few core interests that help keep me relaxed and
                fulfilled, but I try to keep the list small because I’m the kind of person who gets overwhelmed
                when they try to do too many things at once.
              </p>

              <p>
                🍱 I’m really into food! I love to cook (I’ve been particularly enjoying making pizza with my
                outdoor oven) and explore Portland’s food scene, so expect to see plenty of food pics in my
                posts 📸 Visiting Portland and want some recs? Check out my page all about
                <%= link_to "PDX Food", pdx_food_path %>!

              <p>
                ☕️ I’m also a big coffee nerd. I’ve been brewing espresso at home since getting a hand-me-down
                starter machine while I was still in school, so I’ve been at it for even longer than I’ve been
                coding. I can make good espresso pretty consistently, but latte art still mostly eludes me 😅
              </p>

                🎹 I like to play piano for myself to relax at home, but I used to be in bands before the pandemic.
                If you’re at all curious, I’ve been on a
                <a href="https://ezrabell.bandcamp.com/album/dont-all-look-up-at-once" target="_blank">couple</a>
                <a href="https://thejackalopesaints.bandcamp.com/album/ivory-crown" target="_blank">albums</a>
                playing trumpet and keys!

                🐕 I have a little Dachshund/Mini-Pinscher named Susan Bones and I take her on long walks. She’s
                very neurotic and I love her.

              All of the comments, likes, and reposts on this site are powered by
              <a href="https://indieweb.org/Webmention" target="_blank">Webmentions</a>! Most of them automatically
              come from responses to my posts on Mastodon, Bluesky, and other social networks via
              <a href="https://brid.gy/" target="_blank">brid.gy</a>; if you interact with one of my posts on
              those networks, it shows up here too! But the beauty of Webmentions is that you can also respond to
              my posts on your own website; as long as you send a Webmention, and your site is properly marked up
              using <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2" target="_blank">microformats</a>, it’ll
              show up here as if you’d responded on a social network. If you’re interested in learning more about
              Webmentions, or if you sent me a webmention that isn’t showing up on my site, feel free to email me!
