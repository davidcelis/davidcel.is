                Still using a feed reader? Me too! I rely on RSS feeds to keep up
                with other blogs and news sites, so I make sure to provide them
                for my own content as well. Every post I write is syndicated via
                RSS, and I maintain multiple feeds so you can pick and choose from
                whatever you’re interested in:
              </p>

              <p>
                The <%= link_to "main feed", main_feed_path %> has my core posts:
                <%= link_to "articles", articles_path %>, <%= link_to "notes", notes_path %>,
                and <%= link_to "links", links_path %> that I share. You can also subscribe
                to each kind of post individually:
              </p>

              <ul class="list-none">
                <li>
                  <span class="select-none">📝</span>

                  The <%= link_to "articles feed", articles_feed_path %> contains only
                  my long-form <%= link_to "articles", articles_path %>. I write these
                  pretty infrequently, so you won't get too many updates here.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <span class="select-none">✏️</span>

                  The <%= link_to "notes feed", notes_feed_path %> just has my short-form
                  <%= link_to "notes", notes_path %> (aka "tweets" or "lukewarm takes").
                  These are more frequent, but not as much as when I was on Twitter.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <span class="select-none">🔗</span>

                  The <%= link_to "links feed", links_feed_path %> tracks the
                  <%= link_to "links", links_path %> that I share from around the web
                  with a bit of commentary from me. Unlike the other feeds, clicking on
                  the title of a link in your feed reader will take you to the source
                  material instead of my site. If you want to get to my site, you can
                  click on the little 🐴 at the bottom of the entry in your reader.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <span class="select-none">📍</span>

                  The <%= link_to "check-ins feed", check_ins_feed_path %> contains all
                  of my <%= link_to "check-ins", check_ins_path %>. I check in a lot, and
                  you probably won’t really care when I do. But if you do want to see where
                  I’m hanging out or what I’m up to, feel free!
                </li>

                <li>
                  <span class="select-none">📸</span>

                  The <%= link_to "photos feed", photos_feed_path %> has the
                  <%= link_to "photos", photos_path %> that I take and feature on my site.
                  I share pics in different ways, so you’ll see a mix of notes, check-ins,
                  and articles in this feed.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <span class="select-none">🗃️</span>

                  I also have one <%= link_to "mega feed", all_feed_path %> that’ll get you
                  everything I post. I can’t in good conscience recommend it, but it’s there.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3 id="how-to-subscribe">How to Subscribe</h3>

              <p>
                If you’re new to RSS, you’ll need an RSS reader. There are a lot of options
                out there but, if you’re in the Apple ecosystem like me, I highly recommend
                <a href="https://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a>. It’s available for macOS, iOS,
                and iPadOS, and you can subscribe to feeds right from the app and have them
                sync across all of your devices via iCloud.
              </p>

              <p>
                Once you have an RSS reader, you can subscribe to any of the feeds above
                by clicking on their links; that should prompt you to open them in whatever
                reader you’ve installed. If that doesn’t work and they open in your browser
                instead, you can copy the URL and paste it into whatever your reader app’s
                “new subscription” flow is. Thanks for reading!
